For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple
lines:

1,9,10,3, 2,3,11,0, 99, 30,40,50 The first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at
positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1,
addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the
output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input
positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these
numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here,
the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward,
the program looks like this:

1,9,10,70, 2,3,11,0, 99, 30,40,50 Step forward 4 positions to reach the next
opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead
of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and
50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:

3500,9,10,70, 2,3,11,0, 99, 30,40,50 Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives
at opcode 99, halting the program.

Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:

1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2). 2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2
= 6). 2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801). 1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99
becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.
